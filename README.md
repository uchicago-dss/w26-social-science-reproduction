# w26-social-science-reproduction

This project involves reading prominent research papers in the fields of social sciences to replicate their findings using the provided datasets. Reproduction is vitally important in the field of academic research, regardless of the field (economics, political science, sociology, etc). Through this project, members will have the opportunity to learn and develop skills in coding between R and Python (and any additional methods that have been used in these papers). This connection to academic research is a great opportunity for those interested in academic research opportunities of their own under graduate students or professors. 

Project members will cycle through a paper approximately every 3 weeks, where the first week is to get acquainted with it (read the paper in advance and discuss the methodology, context, results, and significance), second week is to do the data analysis, and third week is to see how the paper’s findings can be extended using the data (further data exploration and presentation preparations to a have a deliverable).

Papers for Winter 2026 include: 

* __Opening the black box of college major choice: Evidence from an information intervention__ by Fulya Ersoy and Jamin D. Speer
* **Civic Engagement and Social Connectedness in Rural Communities: The Role of Sociodemographic Factors and Social Determinants of Health in Rural Areas of the United States** by Emma C. Lewis, Galen D. Eldridge, Deyaun L. Villarreal, Meredith L. Graham, Johanna Y. Andrews Trevino, Sara C. Folta, Jay E. Maddock, Meg S. Patterson, Elena Andreyeva, and Rebecca A. Seguin-Fowler
